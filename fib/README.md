# fib

This directory contains two algorithms for generating Fibonacci Numbers. The first is a recursive solution that may be the more obvious.
However, it happens to be very slow once you get past 40ish elements. The second solution is a simple
iterative solution, and it is much faster. I had to use "BigIntegers" to handle the large numbers being generated.
This is an interesting example of two simple algorithms that generate the same answer, but one takes far longer to do so.

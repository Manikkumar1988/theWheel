# theWheel
The Wheel is a project aiming to reinvent algorithms and data structures for fun and education.
It is very much a work in progress, and it likely always will be. As I hear about new algorithms or
interesting data structures, I will attempt to implement them myself to gain a better understanding
of how they really work.

Currently I have used C# for everything in this project, but I would like to expand into other languages in the future.

The rest of this page provides links to each section of content and a small list of website references that I've used
to come up with my list of algorithms and data structures. The items in the lists that are not links have not been implemented yet.

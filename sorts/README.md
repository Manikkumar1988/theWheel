# Sorts

This directory contains several specific sorting algorithms along with code to test and time them.
Currently all the work is in the "Sorting" directory that holds a Visual Studio solution and the code files.

The following algorithms are implemented:
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quicksort
